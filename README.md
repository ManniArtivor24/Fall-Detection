# Fall-Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based fall detection system for elderly care using computer vision and deep learning. By leveraging Pose Estimation (MoveNet) and Optical Flow data, two LSTM models were built to enhance detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

Features
Pose Estimation: Real-time detection of body joints with MoveNet.
Optical Flow Analysis: Tracks motion dynamics to differentiate falls from normal activities.
LSTM Models: Analyze sequential data for precise fall detection.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
